1,1,1,Positive,CL,PR,CST001,EN,"I recently purchased the Samsung TV Frame and I have to say, it has exceeded my expectations. The picture quality is fantastic, with vibrant colors and crisp details that bring my favorite shows and movies to life. What I really love about this TV, however, is the design. The frame around the screen is sleek and modern, making it a beautiful addition to any room. It's almost like having a piece of art on the wall, and I love that I can customize the frame to match my décor. The TV also comes with a no-gap wall mount, which makes installation a breeze. The TV is easy to operate, and I appreciate the intuitive interface that makes it easy to access all my favorite streaming services. Overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase and would highly recommend the Samsung TV Frame to anyone who wants a high-quality TV that doubles as a work of art.",Positive product review on TV Frame,WEB
1,2,2,Negative,CM,PR,CST002,FR,"I have to say I'm disappointed with my purchase of the Samsung TV Frame. While the design is sleek and modern, the picture quality is subpar. The colors are washed out and the details are blurry, making it hard to enjoy my favorite shows and movies. The interface is clunky and difficult to navigate, and I find myself spending more time trying to find what I want to watch than actually enjoying my content. I also had issues with installation, as the wall mount was difficult to install and the TV ended up hanging crooked. While the idea of a TV that doubles as a work of art is intriguing, the execution falls short. I would not recommend the Samsung TV Frame to anyone who is looking for a high-quality viewing experience.",Negative customer exp with Frame TV,TWT
1,3,3,Neutral,SR,RR,CST003,EN,"I have purchased a new Sumsung Frame TV 75' on 1 Feb 2023 from JB Hifi Store in CBD, and invoice number as 12099. I like the massive TV screen, however, its frame color(white) isn’t what I wanted. The sales suggest us to take a white frame first, then exchange for another color later on. I would like to change it for wooden color. Please let's know when it is available. My phone number is 043183473.",Exchange Inquiry of TV Frame,WAC
