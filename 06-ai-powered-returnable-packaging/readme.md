# AI-powered returnable packaging

The source code shared in this repository corresponds to the AI-powered returnable packaging BTP industry use case, please have a look to this [blog]() for more details.

## Description 
The prototyped solution is composed by 3 main blocks:
- SAP AI Core - AI Model in SAP AI Core to detect the packaging type.
-	SAP Kyma â€“ Serverless Function, consuming the AI Core model as well as other BTP Services to implement our AI-returnable packaging backend business logic.
-	SAP Build Apps - user interface allowing the customer to check his/her loyalty points and sustainability goals.
